** Richard Turner's Life Story: Succeeding With Your Hand Dealt
*** Early Adversity (Age 9)
       - Age 9: Scarlet fever destroyed retinas (macula completely destroyed)
       - Vision deteriorated from 20/400 to essentially total blindness by adulthood
       - What others saw: Disability, limitation, impossible future

*** The Turning Point (Age 13+)
       - Refused to learn Braille (rejected victim mentality)
       - Took karate lessons alongside brother → earned 6th degree black belt
       - Joined theater to develop social skills (learning to look people in eye)
       - Trained in trapeze, tightrope, high falls with stuntman
       - Picked up playing cards → discovered enhanced tactile sense
       - Developed "mind's eye" through risk-taking: martial arts, shark hunting, cliff-diving

*** The Philosophy: Winning With What You Have
       - Turner's core belief: "Succeed with the hand that life dealt you"
       - Not making excuses for blindness, but leveraging it as advantage
       - Enhanced touch became superhuman sense (tactile vision)
       - Mental resilience: Tested himself through extreme challenges
       - Result: Became world-class card mechanic despite complete blindness

*** Turner's Career Achievements

       - 4 years entertaining VIPs at Billy Bob's Fort Worth
       - 7 years as Ambassador at Six Flags Fiesta Texas
       - 9 years at Buckhorn Saloon & Museum

       - Won Golden Lion Magic Award (1982)
       - Won "Close-Up Magician of the Year" (2014, 2018) - Oscar of magic world
       - Fooled Penn & Teller on TV (one of fastest ever)

*** Turner's Lesson for Sales Teams
       - "Know what you don't know" → Turner didn't know how to see, but mastered touch
       - Asking for feedback → Learned from mentors (karate master, stuntman, theater coach)
       - Overcoming paralysis → Kept hands on cards constantly, practiced relentlessly

       - Make decisions fast, then handover to next person in chain

** Summary & Action Points for Team
*** Mindset Shifts Needed

       - From: "If buyer says later, accept it"
       - To: "Visit with intent to buy or better not do the visit; set urgency"

       - From: "I must close the deal alone"
       - To: "I'll set up the deal, then take help from team for execution"

*** Daily Actions
