* Slide 1: Title (2 min)
** Daily Sales Growth via Human Psychology & Better Thinking
- Goal: How to sell more, think better, and stay mentally tough – even without technical background.
- This is a practical 30‑minute session: psychology, AI, numbers, mindset.

* Slide 2: Context – Why This Session? (4 min)
** Our Reality at The Purchase House
- Huge variety of machines and huge buying requirements.
- Our Sales team is a mix of tech and non‑tech; even engineers need time to understand our specs.
- Result:
  - Confusion → hesitation → lost deals
  - Focus on “features” instead of *customer problems*
- Today’s focus:
  - Use human psychology + simple analysis instead of deep technical knowledge.

* Slide 3: From Features to Human Psychology (4 min)
** People Decide Emotionally, Justify Rationally
- Customers don’t buy “machines”; they buy:
  - Fewer breakdowns
  - Faster delivery
  - Risk reduction
  - Respect / status in their factory

* Slide 4: Negotiation – Human Psychology, Not Drama (4 min)
** Simple Negotiation Concepts
- BATNA (Best Alternative To a Negotiated Agreement):
  - Know our walk‑away point: price, special terms, delivery time, accessories, 
- Win‑win frame:
  - “Let’s see how we can keep the deal value same but try to add more value from the machine seller.”
- Psychological tactics to *avoid*:
  - Bluffing about non‑existent buyers
  - Last‑minute emotional pressure
- Aim: *long‑term repeat* customers, not one‑time wins.

* Slide 5: WhatsApp as Our Main Weapon (4 min)
** Best Practices for Non‑Technical Team
- Message structure:
  1. Mention context:
     - “Sir, as discussed – machine options for mild steel cutting…”
  2. Make important points **bold**.
  3. Use bullet points instead of long paragraphs.
  4. Highlight 2–3 key deciding points.
  5. For negative replies, use the sandwich method:
     - Start with something positive
     - Mention the negative answer
     - Close with a positive or neutral point.

* Slide 6: AI and the “Genie” Problem (5 min)
** Writing and Thinking for Clarity
- Mimicry vs. thinking:
  - AI can mimic style, but not your unique way of thinking and extrapolating situations.
- The “genie” problem:
  - AI and employees are like literal genies: without specific context, they fill gaps with *their* context.
- Bottleneck identification:
  - Most business bottlenecks are “missing spec” (unclear instructions), not missing skill.

** Leveraging AI for Business Operations
- Deep research:
  - Use AI to list edge cases: equipment, staffing, process checklists.
  - Always verify for hallucinations or outdated info.
- Designing incentives:
  - Ask AI for examples of global sales incentive structures, then adapt to your team.
- Mood‑boarding and referencing:
  - Use AI to generate many references (visuals, scripts, angles) so the team aligns on a vision before execution.

* Slide 7: Mental Arithmetics That Help in Sales (3 min)
** “Meri Aatma Tumhe Hamesha Satayegi”
- While in negotiation stage, you should be able to quickly estimate:
  - Buyer’s charges
  - Seller’s charges
  - Transport cost
  - Lifting / rigging cost
- In addition, you should be aware of:
  - Approximate reserve value of buyer
  - Approximate reserve value of seller
- Goal: rough order of magnitude so you don’t agree to stupid deals.

* Slide 8: Turning Rejection into Data, Not Drama (3 min)
** From Emotional Reaction → Analysis
- After a lost deal, ask 3 questions:
  1. Was it price, trust, timing, or product‑fit?
  2. Did the customer clearly understand our value vs alternative?
  3. What can I change in my next 10 calls based on this?
- Treat each “No” like a failed trek route:
  - Learn, adjust, and attempt the next deal smarter.

* Slide 9: Simple Daily Routine for the Team (2 min)
** 10–15 Minutes of “High‑Quality Improvement”
- At the end of the day:
  - Write down:
    - 1 thing that worked
    - 1 mistake
    - 1 experiment for tomorrow
- Small daily improvement in thinking and behavior → compounding over months.

* Slide 10: Key Takeaways (2 min)
** What I Want You to Remember
- You don’t need deep technical knowledge to sell:
  - You need to understand *people* and *simple numbers*.
- Use:
  - Reciprocity, social proof, consistency, loss aversion – in ethical ways.
  - Simple mental math + clarity in WhatsApp.
- Quote from Munger:
  - “It is remarkable how much long‑term advantage people like us have gotten
    by trying to be consistently not stupid, instead of trying to be very intelligent.”

* Slide 11: Next Steps & Q&A (2 min)
** Next Steps for Our Team
- From you, I expect:
  - 1 new psychological tactic tested in your calls this week.
  - 1 written reflection on a deal you lost and what you learned.

** Q&A
- Questions, objections, and ideas from you.
- Let’s discuss 1–2 real deals you are handling now and apply these concepts live.
