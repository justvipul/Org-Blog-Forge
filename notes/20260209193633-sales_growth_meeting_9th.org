* Slide 1: Title
** Daily Sales Growth via Human Psychology & Better Thinking
- The Purchase House – Used Machine e-Marketplace
- Speaker: Chief Sales Coordinator
- Goal: How to sell more, think better, and stay mentally tough – even without technical background

* Slide 2: Context – Why This Session?
** Our Reality at The Purchase House
- Huge variety of CNC / laser / press brake machines
- Team is non‑technical; even engineers need time to understand specs
- Result: 
  - Confusion → hesitation → lost deals
  - Focus on “features” instead of *customer problems*
- Today’s focus:
  - Use human psychology + simple analysis instead of deep technical knowledge

* Slide 3: From Features to Human Psychology
** People Decide Emotionally, Justify Rationally
- Customers don’t buy “machines”; they buy:
  - Fewer breakdowns
  - Faster delivery
  - Risk reduction
  - Respect / status in their factory
- Key idea (from *Seeking Wisdom*):
  - Understand *how people misjudge* and *how to avoid our own misjudgments*

* Slide 4: 4 Psychological Levers in Sales & Negotiation
1. /Reciprocity/ – people return favours
2. /Social proof/ – people follow others in similar situations
3. /Commitment & consistency/ – once they say “yes” to small things, they like to stay consistent
4. /Loss aversion/ – people fear losses more than they value gains

(We will connect each to used‑machine sales.)

* Slide 5: Reciprocity – Give First, Then Ask
** How to Use in Our Sales
- Before pushing for PO, create value:
  - Share a simple comparison:
    - “Here are 2–3 options by budget and job type”
  - Send a quick video explaining key difference (rpm, bed size, power) in *simple language*
  - Share one practical tip:
    - e.g. “How to inspect a used machine in 10 minutes”
- WhatsApp examples:
  - “Sir, I made a small 1‑page summary for you: [PDF / image]”
  - “Here is a machine inspection checklist – free, use with any dealer”

* Slide 6: Social Proof – “People Like You Buy This”
** Remove Risk by Showing Others
- Buyers ask internally: “Have similar companies bought this?”
- Use:
  - Stories: “Last month a Pune job‑shop with 6 VMCs chose this machine because…”
  - Numbers: “We have placed 12 similar machines in Maharashtra in last 6 months”
- On WhatsApp:
  - Before/after photos
  - Short testimonial audio/text from happy client (with permission)

* Slide 7: Consistency – Get Small “Yes” First
** Step‑by‑Step Commitment
- Don’t jump to PO. Move client through small commitments:
  1. “Can I WhatsApp you 2–3 options with pros/cons?” → Yes
  2. “Can we do a 10‑minute video call to see the machine live?” → Yes
  3. “If this fits, can we plan an inspection on Friday?” → Yes
- Once they say “yes” repeatedly, saying “no” to order becomes psychologically harder

* Slide 8: Loss Aversion – Sell by Highlighting Avoided Pain
** Customers Hate Losses More Than They Love Gains
- Examples of pains:
  - Machine breakdown during urgent order
  - Scrap and rework
  - Unplanned maintenance cost
- Talk in “loss avoided” language:
  - “This model reduces downtime risk because parts are easily available”
  - “This dealer gives proper service history – saves you surprise repair bills”

* Slide 9: Negotiation – Human Psychology, Not Drama
** Simple Negotiation Concepts
- BATNA (Best Alternative To a Negotiated Agreement):
  - Know our walk‑away point: price, credit terms, delivery time
- Win‑win frame:
  - “Let’s see how we can fit your budget and still protect your production risk”
- Psychological tactics to *avoid*:
  - Bluffing about non‑existent buyers
  - Last‑minute emotional pressure
- We want *long‑term repeat* customers, not one‑time wins

* Slide 10: WhatsApp as Our Main Weapon
** Best Practices for Non‑Technical Team
- Clean profile:
  - DP = logo / professional photo
  - Status = short line: “Used CNC / Laser / Press Brake – The Purchase House”
- Message structure:
  1. /Context/: “Sir, as discussed – machine options for mild steel cutting”
  2. /Options/: 2–3 short bullets per machine, no jargon
  3. /CTA/: “Shall we inspect Option 2 on Thursday 3 PM?”
- Use:
  - Broadcast lists for updates (not random spam)
  - Quick voice notes when text is too long

* Slide 11: Using AI to Save Time (Non‑Technical Friendly)
** Practical AI Use‑Cases for Us
- 1) Drafting messages & proposals:
  - Input: “Client wants 2m x 4m laser, 6–8mm mild steel, budget 30–35L, write a short proposal”
- 2) Clarifying technical terms:
  - “Explain difference between CO2 laser and fiber laser to a non‑technical buyer in 5 points”
- 3) Preparing comparison sheets:
  - “Compare Machine A vs Machine B for SME job shop – focus: maintenance, space, power, accuracy”
- 4) Translating:
  - English ↔ Hindi/Marathi for local comfort
- Golden rule:
  - AI drafts, *you* verify & customise

* Slide 12: Simple Analysis – Think Like Munger
** Before Pushing a Machine, Ask:
- “What could go wrong for the buyer?”
  - Parts availability?
  - Service support?
  - Operator skill?
- “Am I overtrusting my own idea?”
  - Overconfidence & confirmation bias are common
- “If this deal fails later, what will client blame us for?”
  - Keep that risk on your radar and address upfront

* Slide 13: GST & % – Fast Mental Math for Sales
** Quick Tricks for Indian GST (18% / 28%)
- 18% GST trick:
  - 10% = move decimal one place left
  - 5% = half of 10%
  - 3% ≈ one‑third of 10%
- Example: Basic price = ₹10,00,000; GST 18%
  - 10% = 1,00,000
  - 5% = 50,000
  - 3% ≈ 30,000
  - Total GST ≈ 1,80,000 → Invoice ≈ 11,80,000
- 28% GST (if needed):
  - 30% of 10,00,000 = 3,00,000
  - minus 2% (20,000) = 2,80,000

** Discount + GST Quick Check
- If client asks 5% discount on 10,00,000:
  - 5% = 50,000 → new basic = 9,50,000
  - GST 18% ≈ 1,71,000 (18% of 9.5L)
  - Approx invoice ≈ 11,21,000
- Train team to do ballpark mental math so they look confident on calls

* Slide 14: “Seeking Wisdom” – Avoiding Sales Misjudgments
** 4 Common Thinking Errors from Peter Bevelin / Munger
1. Overconfidence:
   - “Ye deal toh pakka hai” after one positive call
2. Incentive‑caused bias:
   - Pushing wrong machine because commission is higher
3. Commitment & consistency:
   - Sticking to a bad quote because “we already sent it”
4. Social proof:
   - Copying other salespeople’s bad habits because “everyone does it”
** Antidote:
- Slow down, ask “And then what?” before promising anything

* Slide 15: Stoic Mindset from Trekking
** Sahyadri Treks → Sales Resilience
- On a tough trek:
  - You face fear of height, fatigue, weather, sometimes real fear of death
- After that:
  - A client saying “No” or “Your price is high” is nothing
- Stoic idea:
  - Focus only on what you can control:
    - Number of quality calls
    - Quality of follow‑ups
    - Clarity of communication
    - Honesty and effort
  - Accept what you cannot control:
    - Market mood
    - Client’s internal politics
    - Competitor’s random discount

* Slide 16: Turning Rejection into Data, Not Drama
** From Emotional Reaction → Analysis
- After lost deal, ask 3 questions:
  1. Was it price, trust, timing or product‑fit?
  2. Did the customer clearly understand our value vs alternative?
  3. What can I change in my next 10 calls based on this?
- Treat each “No” like a failed trek route:
  - Learn, adjust, and attempt next route smarter

* Slide 17: Simple Daily Routine for the Team
** 60–90 Minutes of “High Quality Sales Work”
- 20–30 min:
  - Plan – top 10 prospects, WhatsApp follow‑ups, AI‑drafted proposals
- 30–40 min:
  - Focused calling + WhatsApp with:
    - Reciprocity
    - Social proof
    - Clear next step
- 10–15 min:
  - Post‑mortem of the day:
    - 1 thing worked, 1 mistake, 1 experiment for tomorrow

* Slide 18: Key Takeaways
** What I Want You to Remember
- You don’t need deep technical knowledge to sell:
  - You need to understand *people* and *simple numbers*
- Use:
  - Reciprocity, social proof, consistency, loss aversion in ethical ways
  - WhatsApp + AI to save time and look professional
  - Simple GST / % mental math for confidence
  - Stoic trekking mindset to digest rejection and keep going
- Quote from Munger:
  - “It is remarkable how much long‑term advantage people like us have gotten
    by trying to be consistently not stupid, instead of trying to be very intelligent.”
