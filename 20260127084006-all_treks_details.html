<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-orgaf94f7d">
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Region: Kalsubai–Harishchandragad Wildlife Sanctuary, Ahmednagar district.[web:3]</li>
<li>Height: 1646 m / 5400 ft (highest peak of Maharashtra).[web:3]</li>
<li>Grade: Moderate; long climb with iron ladders, suitable for fit beginners.[web:1][web:5]</li>
<li>Route: Standard Bari village route; fields → gradual slope → multiple iron ladders → summit temple plateau.[web:1][web:3]</li>
<li>Trek time: ~3–4 hrs ascent, 2–3 hrs descent; total 6–7 hrs with breaks.[web:3]</li>
<li>Access: Drive/bus to Bari from Nashik via Ghoti–Bhandardara side; paid parking in village.[web:3]</li>
<li>Best season: Oct–Feb for views; monsoon for clouds (more slippery).[web:5]</li>
<li>Water/food: Carry 2–3 L water; stalls with tea/poha often present in season, but don’t depend fully.[web:5]</li>
<li>Safety: Start pre-dawn for sunrise; ladders can jam on weekends; rock &amp; metal are very slippery in rain.[web:1]</li>
<li>Fact: From the top you can see Harishchandragad, Ratangad and other major Sahyadri peaks on a clear day.[web:3]</li>

<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-org000f700">
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Region: Near Nashik, in the Peth range of the Western Ghats.[web:6][web:15]</li>
<li>Height: ~1000 m / ~3297 ft (approx).[web:6]</li>
<li>Grade: Easy–Moderate; mostly forested trail with a final rocky section near the fort structures.[web:6]</li>
<li>Route: Forest entry → gentle jungle trail → a couple of steeper forested climbs → open ridge with views → ruined fort walls/structure.[web:6][web:10]</li>
<li>Trek time: 2–3 hrs ascent, 1.5–2 hrs descent.</li>
<li>Access: From Nashik by road towards Peth region; local guidance is very helpful because of similar-looking forest tracks.[web:15]</li>
<li>Best season: Post-monsoon to winter; monsoon makes the forest lush but also more leech-prone and slippery.</li>
<li>Water/food: No reliable water on trail; carry full requirement from base (2–3 L); food only in nearby villages, so tiffin is best.</li>
<li>Safety: Forest sections can be confusing; stay with group and avoid venturing off-track; watch for loose soil and leaf-covered stones.</li>
<li>Fact: Dehergad/Bhorgad area is part of a reforestation and biodiversity recovery story where local efforts helped bring back green cover and wildlife.[web:7][web:11]</li>
<li>Quote: “Some forts roar with crowds, others like Dehergad whisper through trees and broken stones.”</li>

<li>Route: Entry point → forest track → viewpoints over reforested slopes and small water bodies; specific paths vary by guide and permission.</li>

<li>Water/food: Treat as a half-day walk but still carry water and light snacks.</li>
<li>Safety: Area touches sensitive/IAF-linked zones; always respect boundaries, follow guides, and avoid off-trail wandering.</li>
<li>Fact: Around 1.5–2.5 lakh trees have been planted here over years as part of major afforestation drives, transforming the hill’s biodiversity.[web:7][web:11]</li>

<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-org043bae8">
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Region: Near Malegaon, north-east of Nashik, in the Satmala / adjoining range.[web:14]</li>
